\alias{matrix_libFM}
\title{Converts a matrix to libFM format}
\usage{
matrix_libFM(mat, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{matrix to be converted. Can either be a standard matrix
or a sparse matrix}

\item{y}{The response variable. If unavailable (for test data), a
  1 is used because libFM requires a response.}
}
\value{
a character vector with one value per observation
}
\description{
Converts a matrix to libFM format
}
\details{
If your data consists of factor variables with a lot of levels,
  model_frame_libFM is much faster than matrix_libFM.
}
\examples{
data(movie_lense)
movie_lense_sub = tail(movie_lense, 10)

# model.matrix will remove the reference level
# which may not be desireable is some situations
movie_lense_mm = model.matrix(Rating ~ User + Movie, data = movie_lense_sub)

# remove intercept
movie_lense_mm = movie_lense_mm[, -1]

movie_lense_libFM = matrix_libFM(movie_lense_mm, movie_lense_sub$Rating)
movie_lense_libFM
